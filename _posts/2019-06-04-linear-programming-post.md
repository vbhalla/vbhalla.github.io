I was married a few years ago and have been trying to be a grown up ever since, I think other people may empathize as there are just so many things to consider.  After working on Wall Street and several FinTech startups spanning personal finance, financial planning, mortgage, and property and casualty insurance.....embarrasingly I didn't ever consider life insurance.  My wife and I realized that we both should have probably gotten some earlier in our lives when things were much cheaper, but better late than never, right?

There are a lot of views on how much life insurance coverage you need, with one quick google search you likely find lots of methods ranging from the extremely simple (i.e. a multiple X age bracket, to more complex cashflow modeling around projected income and/or expenses). For your sake, I'll just keep this post focused the fun data/math things I did :-)
