### Little More About Me

In my spare time I like to play with my puppy, easy hiking, riding his bike around Jersey City, and traveling with his better half.

Below is a hike we took in Tanzania, where I proposed and thankfully she said yes; phewww saving me from an awkward 2 days down the mountain had she not. The other love of my life is our puppy Lassi<br>
